\section{Outline}

The rest of the thesis is organized as follows. We begin by providing some background and definitions in section 2
that are useful for the understanding of the algorithms and methods described in section 3 and 4. Section 3 introduces Mirror Decsent
and expands on Mirror Descent based methods for solving Reinforcement learning problems. Section 4 discusses combining novel improvements
on top of these methods and discusses their structure and the expected effects. In Section 5, we dive into some experimental results and
discuss the performance of these algorithms in different settings. We then close the thesis with some discussion.
