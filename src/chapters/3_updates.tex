\chapter{Faster MMD and MDPO}

\section{Faster-MMD}

We now propose a few modified versions of Magnetic Mirror Descent, and MDPO

\section{Neural Replicator Dynamics (NeuRD)} Neural Replicator Dynamics (NeuRD)
\cite{hennesNeural2020} is a model-free sample-based algorithm that applies function approximation
to Replicator Dynamics.
Replicator Dynamics is an idea from Evolutionary game theory (EGT) that defines operators to update
the dynamics of a population in ord to maximize some pay-off defined by a fitness function.

The single-population replicator dynamics is defined by the following system of differntial
equations:

\begin{equation}
	\label{eqn:rd} \dot{\pi}(a) = \pi(a)[u(a, \pi) -
		\bar{u}(\pi)], \forall a \in \mathcal{A}
\end{equation}

Hennes et.
al, \cite{hennesNeural2020} show equivalence between Softmax Policy gradients
\ref{sec:spg} and continuous-time Replicator Dynamics \cite[THEOREM 1, on p5]{hennesNeural2020}\label{thm:spgrd}.

NeuRD can be applied to reinforcement learning as a single line change to the Softmax Policy
gradient.
This can be seen as applying a fix to the update of the Softmax Policy gradient algorithm to make
it more responsive to changes in a non-stationary environment.
We refer to this as the ``NeuRD-fix''.

\subsection{FMMD-N}

The first modified version of MMD, and MDPO is obtained applying the NeuRD-fix to these algorithms.
Below, we derive the gradient of the behavioral form update rule for these algorithms, and show
where the fix applies in these updates.

\section{Extragradient updates}

The Extragradient method was first introduced by G.M.Korpelevich~\cite{korpelevichEG1976}.
EG is a classical method for solving smooth and strongly convex-concave bilinear saddle point
problems with a linear rate of convergence.
Extragradient and Optimistic Gradient Descent Ascent methods have been shown to be approximations
of proximal-point method for solving saddle point methods~\cite{mokhtariUnified2020}.

\subsection{FMMD-EG}
In this section, we outline a version of MMD with extragradient updates that we call
\textit{FMMD-EG}.
