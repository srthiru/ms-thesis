\chapter{Background}

We begin by providing some necessary background in Game Theory, Online Learning, and Reinforcement
learning to make the reader familiar with the concepts required to follow the ideas discussed in
the following sections.

\section{Game Theory}
- what is game theory?
- why is it useful?
- how is it related?

\subsection{Problem Domains and Representations}
- how are problems typically represented in game theory?
- what are the usual representations?
Normal Form games, Extensive Form games, Sequence Form.
- how is this relevant?

\subsection{Solution Concepts}
- what are solution concepts?
- what are the common solution concepts?
Nash equilibrium, Quantal response equilibrium.
- what are the relevant information related to solution conepts for this work?
Existence of a nash equilibrium Uniqueness of QRE

\section{Reinforcement
  Learning}

\subsection{Policy gradient methods}

\subsubsection{Softmax Policy Gradients}\label{sec:spg}

\subsection{PPO}

\section{Online Learning}

- what is online learning?

Online learning is the study of designing algorithms that use historical knowledge in predicting
actions for future rounds while trying to minimize some loss function in an adaptive (possibly
adversarial) setting.

- why is it useful?
- why is it relevant here?

\subsection{FoReL}\label{sec:forel}
- what is forel?
- relevant info?

\subsection{Hedge}
- what is hedge?
