\chapter{Conclusion}
In this thesis, we studied mirror-descent based methods applied to two-player zero-sum games, and
proposed modifications to these algorithms to achieve last-iterate convergence.
We experimentally We discussed how the various modifications are reoccuring components in general
reinforcement learning and game-theoretic algorithms.
We also raise interesting observations that stand out from our experimental evaluations some of
which coincide with previous findings, and others are less understood phenomena.
We believe these findigns are useful in the design of reinforcement learning algorithms for
two-player zero-sum games and beyond.
